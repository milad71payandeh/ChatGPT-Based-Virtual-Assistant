# ChatGPT-Based Virtual-Assistant
Super Dynamic Virtual Assistant Using ChatGPT

This project is implemented on Pycharm.

First, it is necessary to install the libraries used in the program.

Then you need to create an account on the OpenAI website. And get an **openai.api_key** through your user account and put it in the appropriate place in the program.

Now you can easily talk about anything you like with your **ChatGPT-Based** voice assistant.
